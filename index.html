        <h2>Thoon Thoon: Exploring Final Fantasy XIV’s Vast World with a Casual Playstyle</h2>
        <img src="img/Blog 1.jpg" alt="Blog 1" class="Blog_Pic">
        <p>Thoon Thoon, an avid player of the popular game Final Fantasy XIV, enjoys exploring the vast world of Eorzea. As a casual player, they find great pleasure in engaging with various types of content, ranging from casual encounters to occasionally venturing into more challenging extreme battles. While Thoon Thoon appreciates the excitement that savage content offers, they often find themselves limited by time constraints, making it difficult to invest the necessary effort to study and conquer these intense encounters. Nonetheless, they have a deep passion for crafting and gathering, delighting in the ability to create and collect valuable resources. Fishing, on the other hand, doesn’t captivate them as much, finding it rather monotonous and less appealing. With a well-rounded approach to Final Fantasy XIV, Thoon Thoon embraces the game’s diverse activities, aiming to experience the best it has to offer within their personal playstyle and preferences.</p>

        <h2>Staying Steadfast: My Commitment to the Classic Critical Hit/Direct Hit Summoner Build</h2>
        <img src="img/Blog 2.jpg" alt="Blog 2" class="Blog_Pic">
        <p>As a long-time Summoner, I’ve journeyed through numerous battles, experienced myriad strategies, and explored various build options to optimize my performance in Eorzea. With the advent of Endwalker and the rise of the spell speed build around February 2022, it’s become the standard path for many Summoners, with its enhanced damage output and quickened casting times making it a compelling choice​.<br>

        <br>However, I’ve remained steadfast in my affinity for the classic critical hit/direct hit build, despite the current meta’s shift towards spell speed. I’ve always found there to be a certain charm in the balance of consistent damage and the thrill of critical hits that this build offers.<br>
            
        <br>Now, I hear you asking, “Aren’t you at a disadvantage?” In terms of raw damage output and speed, perhaps so. However, I firmly believe that there’s more to our role as Summoners than merely dealing the highest DPS possible. It’s about understanding your class, adapting to the situation, and most importantly, enjoying the game.<br>
            
        <br>While the spell speed build might reign supreme in the current meta, the critical hit/direct hit build is far from obsolete. It continues to offer a reliable, well-rounded approach to combat that can hold its own in most situations. Moreover, it serves as a testament to the diversity of playstyles that Final Fantasy XIV encourages, celebrating the unique paths that each player can forge in their journey.<br>
            
        <br>So to all my fellow Summoners who still embrace the critical hit/direct hit build, remember that our chosen path is not defined by the meta, but by our passion for the game, our understanding of our class, and our determination to succeed, no matter the odds.<br>
            
        <br>In the end, it’s not about which build is superior, but about how we choose to navigate the ever-evolving world of Final Fantasy XIV. So whether you’re a spell speed enthusiast or a devotee of the classic build like me, let’s continue to honor the spirit of adventure that binds us all.<br>
            
        <br>And as always, I welcome any feedback or insights from the community. The journey of learning is endless, and I’m eager to grow along with all of you.</p>

        <h2>The Joys of a Static Group: A Casual Player’s Perspective</h2>
        <img src="img/Blog 3.jpg" alt="Blog 3" class="Blog_Pic">
        <p>Regular players of Final Fantasy XIV know that the arrival of a new patch brings a flurry of activity. Everyone rushes to complete the Main Scenario Quest (MSQ), eager to test out the latest dungeons and trials. The game buzzes with excitement, particularly when new extreme trials and savages are released. These can be intimidating yet thrilling challenges.<br>

            <br>For us casual players, extreme content is intriguing and can even be enjoyable. Savage content, however, often feels like a different level altogether. Some might think it’s too difficult or time-consuming for those who don’t play as often or as seriously. But I’ve found that playing with a static group can make even the most challenging content more approachable and enjoyable.<br>
            
            <br>Contrary to what some might think, a static group isn’t necessarily a group of hardcore players trying to clear the highest end content. In my experience, it’s more about camaraderie, understanding, and sticking together through thick and thin. It’s about enjoying the game with friends and growing together as a team.<br>
            
            <br>I’ve participated in a wide range of content, from the level 50 extreme trials to Zodiark, Hydaelyn, Endsinger trials, and now the latest Golbez. I’ve also tackled some Pandemonium Savage. Among all these experiences, the ones I’ve shared with my static group have been the most enjoyable.<br>
            
            <br>While Party Finder can offer a quick way to join a group, it comes with its share of uncertainties and challenges. In the Party Finder, there's a stress to not be a burden to others and a possibility of meeting impatient people. While FFXIV is typically comprised of nice people, there are always exceptions. In contrast, a static group offers safety and familiarity. Even when we wipe, we learn from it and grow stronger as a team. We’re patient with each other, and there’s no pressure to be perfect. This allows us to focus more on the mechanics than on avoiding a wipe, which helps us enjoy the content more.<br>
            
            <br>In fact, I firmly believe that the more you die, the more you get used to the mechanics. I can still remember the death toll we took in SOS Extreme to the level that sometimes my hands automatically move when the boss is casting a spell, even before my brain can work out the mechanics. I can do this not because I’m a top-tier player, but because of the experiences I’ve had with my static group.<br>
            
            <br>In conclusion, I’d like to encourage all casual players to consider joining or forming a static group. It’s not about being the best or clearing the most difficult content. It’s about enjoying the game with friends, growing as a player, and making lasting memories in the vibrant world of Final Fantasy XIV.</p>
