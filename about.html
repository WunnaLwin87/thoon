    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Thoon Thoon’s Final Fantasy XIV adventures. My name is Thoon Thoon, an avid player and enthusiast of the popular game Final Fantasy XIV. I have spent countless hours exploring the vast world of Eorzea, engaging with various types of content ranging from casual encounters to occasionally venturing into more challenging extreme battles. I created this site as a platform to share my experiences in the expansive world of Eorzea.<br>

      <br>While I enjoy the thrill that savage content offers, my true passion lies in crafting and gathering. I take great pleasure in the meticulous process of creating and collecting valuable resources, uncovering the hidden intricacies of the game’s crafting system, and sharing my discoveries with fellow gamers.<br>
      
      <br>However, this website isn’t just about me. It’s about helping you, the reader, navigate the intricacies of Final Fantasy XIV. Here, you will find my take on crafting, gathering, the gears I use, my crafting rotations, my raid and dungeon gear, and more. Whether you’re a beginner just setting foot in Eorzea or a seasoned player looking to optimize your crafting and gathering, there’s something here for you.<br>
      
      <br>I believe in the importance of sharing my experiences – both the triumphs and the struggles – as I navigate through the game. My mission is to provide reliable, accessible, and practical information that will help you get the most out of your Final Fantasy XIV experience. I am committed to providing accurate and helpful information, but there may be times when I make a mistake or overlook something. I greatly appreciate and always welcome feedback from the community to help me correct and improve the content on this site.<br>
      
      <br>So, join me as we explore the diverse activities that Final Fantasy XIV has to offer, all tailored to accommodate our personal playstyles and preferences. Let’s embark on this journey together!<br>
